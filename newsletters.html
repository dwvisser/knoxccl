  <p><b>August 12 Climate Workshop Event.</b> Saturday, August 12, the <b>CCL Climate Advocate Workshop</b>, was a fantastic, participatory experience for the Greater Knoxville CCL Chapter. The training, conducted by two national CCL representatives, <b>Don Kraus</b>, Field Development Coordinator, and <b>Jim Tolbert</b>, Conservative Outreach Director, provided excellent guidance and instruction on the function and goals of our chapter. It emphasized Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s philosophy and details of how its solution, Carbon Fee and Dividend, works. We had 29 very impressive attendees, whose backgrounds covered a range of scientific and professional interests, all of who vigorously joined into the workshop happenings. Thanks to all for your contributions to the workshop and to chapter members who provided venue, refreshments and cleanup.</p>
  
  <h4>September Commentary</h4>

  <p>We plan to be an active, all inclusive, total participatory Chapter of CCL, where each member contributes according to her/his desire and time available. The advantages of being associated with CCL are many, including helping solve the critical global problem of climate change, having a tangible impact on a significant issue; recognizing that if we complete our designated mission, we have achieved the single goal of our Chapter and the Citizens’ Climate Lobby; and, last, but certainly not least, becoming friends with concerned citizens, who are united on climate change. Thank you for your interest and help directed towards maintaining a sustainable health of our environment. The Greater Knoxville Chapter of CCL needs and welcomes you, your talents and your expertise! </p>
  
  <h4 id="2017-09-meeting">September Chapter Meeting</h4>

  <p>A tentative <b>Agenda</b> for Monday, September 18, 6:00 – 8:00pm is </p>

  </ul>
  
  <h5>Clarification of Team Formations and Reports</h5>
  <p>Please note, we are requesting brief information reports from Chapter Teams following a very short Team Planning session. This is an unusual and ambitious request; first, because we have not had a meeting of the group, and, second, you might not even know that you are, or will be on a team. A reason for starting so energetically is our work is critical, becoming more essential every day, and hopefully this will get our members communicating, so that meetings need not be spent on organizational items, but on production. Also, some of you have already started discussions, and this provides an opportunity to proceed. 
  The teams, cluster topics, suggested goals, and team members are provided for guidance and are only tentative, all certainly subject to change. The team members are suggested by reading of the workshop interest sheets, those turned in at the end of the workshop. If you did not attend the workshop, or if you attended and did not fill out the interest form, you are not listed in a team; however, you may be added to a team of your choice. Please join a team during the Set Up and Greet portion of the meeting. Again, you need not stay in the team in which you are suggested, this is only a preliminary suggestion based upon minimal data. All the suggestions below are preludes, given only to provide nominal guidance, and subject to the interests of the team. Clusters are to emphasize more specific task areas than the team classification, and may consist of only a few individuals… a few may be one, if that is all required or interested in the task. Please be thinking about what you can do for GKCCL.</p>

<p><b>July Event Report.</b> Thanks to the talented group of folks that
  attended the Meet and Greet session on July 19, at the Earth Fare in
  Turkey Creek. The 27 people there appreciated the introductory
  information provided by our speaker, Don Kraus, CCL Field Development
  Coordinator, who drove in from Asheville for this occasion.  Thanks,
  Don, we welcome the encouragement and useful suggestions you made about
  activities of our Chapter. A encouraging event occurred when a meeting
  of a faith group, who were in an adjoining room, ended while we were
  still in session. Some came in, pulled up chairs, and were a most
  welcome addition.</p>

  <p><b>August 11 Community TV Climate Event.</b> Our Advocate Workshop
  leaders, national CCL representatives, Don Kraus, Field Development
  Coordinator, and Jim Tolbert, Conservative Outreach Director, will join

  Advocate Workshop. The meeting time of the workshop is 9:00 am - 12:30
  pm at The University of Tennessee, Agricultural Campus, 2500 East J.

  <p>The Workshop will include a brief introduction to climate change
  basics, Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s philosophy and details of how its
  solution, Carbon Fee and Dividend, works. We will identify the primary
  political levers necessary to help reduce the impact of fossil fuels on
  our environment – including lobbying, media relations, grassroots
  outreach, grasstops outreach and chapter development. Please be thinking
  about where your strengths will serve this worthy cause the best and be
  prepared to join a team that will focus on one of these political
  levers. Participants will learn and practice how to lobby, engage the
  media and give short “laser talks” on climate change solutions.</p>
  
  <p>This workshop is open to all interested in the health of our
  environment. Please join us if you are curious about what you as an
  individual can do, or about what a group of concerned people can

<h3>July 15, 2017</h3>

<p><b>For those interested in improving the health of our environment.</b>
  If we individually strive to minimize our carbon footprints, we will
  have an influence. Regrettably, because all individuals will not, or
  cannot, minimize for numerous reasons, the totality of individual
  impacts probably will not significantly change our environment. To begin
  a rigorous attack on the problem, our population, the aggregate of
  individuals, must be offered an alternative to carbon utilization, one
  that is economically viable. The U. S., as the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions">number
    2 carbon emitter
  in the world</a>, must constrain fossil fuels before they arrive at the
  buyer level, and concurrently provide a fiscally responsible, achievable
  replacement. This is exactly the approach and single goal of our
  Citizens’ Climate Lobby. CCL has a solution, now the work begins,
  respectfully persuading skeptics and generating support. Please check
  out our website, <a href="https://knoxccl.org/">knoxccl.org</a>, connect
  with us, and help solve the carbon pollution problem.</p>

<p><b>July Meeting.</b> Just a gentle reminder that the Citizens’ Climate
  Lobby will have an
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Citizens-Climate-Lobby-Knoxville/events/241288986/">informal
    Meet and Greet gathering</a> on Wednesday, July 19th, 7 pm, at the
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/C2jn18WFftD2">Earth Fare in Turkey Creek,
    10903 Parkside Drive, Knoxville</a>. Even if
    you cannot arrive at 7, please join us for a brief discussion, led by
    Don Kraus, CCL regional development director, probably starting about
    7:30.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT. August News Item.</b> A Climate Advocate Training
  workshop will be offered by the Greater Knoxville Chapter of the
  Citizens’ Climate Lobby on Saturday, August 12, 9:00 am – 12 noon, on
  the University of Tennessee Agricultural Campus,
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J5JxqUWw21A2">2500 EJ Chapman Drive</a>,
  Biosystems Engineering and Soil Sciences Bldg., Room 268. The session is
  free and will teach citizens the intricacies of building political will
  and affecting change in positive, constructive ways. Citizens’ Climate
  Lobby (CCL) has a unique approach of achieving change through building
  positive, respectful relationships with lawmakers and focusing on
  specific market-based, consumer-friendly solutions that have received
  support from conservatives and liberals alike. The workshop will include
  a mini-lobbying training.</p>
