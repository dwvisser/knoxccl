<h3>About Our Chapter</h3>

    <p>We are a chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL) established to
    focus on the impacts of climate change on the Greater Knoxville
    region. Climate change touches each of us individually, as well as collectively in our
    communities.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in our beautiful East
    Tennessee environment, you are invited to attend our open meetings.
    You will be greeted respectfully whatever your political
    leanings: Republican, Democrat or Independent. You may
    believe that climate change is real or if you have doubts about its
    validity. You may have abundant funds or have less. You may be younger or older.
    <em>All</em> are welcome to the Greater Knoxville Citizens' Climate Lobby meetings.</p>

<h3>About CCL</h3>

    <p>Citizens’ Climate Lobby is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots
    advocacy organization empowering people to experience breakthroughs
    exercising their personal and political power. Our chapter is just one
    of hundreds of chapters across the world working to create the
    political will for a livable world.</p>

    <p>We are laser-focused on a specific piece of legislation and a proven
    strategy to gain its passage. We are working for the passage of
    <a href="http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/">Carbon
    Fee and Dividend</a>, the climate change solution economists and
    climate scientists alike say is the “best first-step” to preventing
    the worst impacts of a warming world.</p>

    <p>Our market-based Carbon Fee and Dividend policy will drastically
    reduce emissions, create jobs, and support small businesses and
    families — all without growing government.</p>

    <p>We’ve seen firsthand how passionate citizens who are well-trained,
    organized by district and with a good system of support can positively
    influence the political process.</p>
