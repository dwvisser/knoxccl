<p>The Greater Knoxville Chapter of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby monthly meeting will
be held on <b>Monday, October 16, 6:25 – 7:45 p. m.</b> at the Bearden Public Library, 100 Golfclub Rd, Knoxville TN. Chapter activities will begin at 6:00 pm and end at 8:00 pm, with the meeting formally
starting at 6:25 p. m. The meeting, will have a short educational unit about activities and progress of CCL
during the past month, and will primarily be devoted to defining team action items for the Chapter. It was decided not to have an educational speaker this month in order that team coordination and
objectives can be addressed. The Liaisons (see below) will need help in formulation of contact ideas for
approaching and discussing CCL, so please think about recent positive environmental contributions of
Representive Fleishmann and the City of Knoxville so those can be used in the Liaison meeting.</p>
