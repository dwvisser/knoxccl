The Greater Knoxville Chapter of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby monthly meeting
will be held on Monday, November 20, 2017, 6:25 – 7:45 PM at the Bearden
Public Library, 100 Golfclub Rd, Knoxville TN. Chapter activities will begin
at 6:00 PM and end at 8:00 PM, with the meeting formally starting at 6:25 PM.
One decision to be made at the meeting is the date of the month for our future
meetings. We have several members who have conflicts on the 3rd Mondays, and
we would like to accommodate all, so please come, or if you are unable to
attend, please inform a member of your desired meeting dates. We have some
liaison teams organized to achieve our goal of support of the Citizens’
Climate Lobby Reports on the Carbon Fee and Dividend. More team members and
support volunteers are needed, please help us to achieve carbon reduction.
Liaison progress will be given. An agenda for the meeting will be sent in the
future.
