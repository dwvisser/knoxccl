<h3>About Our Chapter</h3>

  <p>We are a chapter of the
    <a href=https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Citizens'
       Climate Lobby</a> (CCL) established to focus on the impacts of climate change
    on the Greater Knoxville region. Climate change touches each of us individually,
    as well as collectively in our communities.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in our beautiful East Tennessee environment, you are
    invited to attend our open meetings. You will be greeted respectfully whatever
    your political leanings: Republican, Democrat or Independent. You may believe
    that climate change is real or if you have doubts about its validity. You may
    have abundant funds or have less. You may be younger or older. <em>All</em> are
    welcome to the Greater Knoxville Citizens' Climate Lobby
    meetings.</p>
