            Note the November 8 Congressional Call In Day. See info below.</p>

        <p><b>ACTION ITEM: Make plans for November 8 Congressional Call-in
            LOBBY ACTION</b> Imagine that the lobby team for your member of
            Congress hears at the start of their lobby meeting: “We got so
            many calls in support of carbon fee and dividend on Wednesday!”
            Wouldn’t that be helpful!  That’s why we are asking you to
            organize your group, friends and family to call their
            Representative and Senators on Wednesday, November 8th, to ask
            them to enact carbon fee and dividend. If they don’t get through
            on November 8th, they can leave a message in the evening or try
            calling on November 9th. Calling on the 8th will allow time for
            tallies to be communicated through to the Congressional
            office.</p>
