<h2>October 2017 Newsletter</h2>

<p>Many thanks to all who have participated in our Chapter events. The
    volunteer hours we have spent are fundamental to achieving a reduction in
    the greenhouse gases impact our environment. We have made a good start,
    with efforts by many energetic, concerned individuals, but we are not
    finished. Keep up the important work, let’s accomplish our goal of
    implementing A Carbon Fee and Dividend.</p>

    <p>Several members expressed interest in joining a group to go to the
        meeting.</p></li>

<li>Dr. Scott Painter of the Climate Change Science Institute, Oak Ridge
    National Laboratory, Oak Ridge TN presented a talk about Climate Change
    and East Tennessee. Following an introduction to climate change
    principles, Scott explained some data and model simulation results
    indicate that the high levels atmospheric carbon observed today have
    occurred previously, but the rapid increase is unprecedented. Simulations
    suggest this increase is due to man’s usage of carbon-based fuels. He
    discussed the physics of climate change that justifies the multitudes of
    current extreme events now impacting the earth.</li>
